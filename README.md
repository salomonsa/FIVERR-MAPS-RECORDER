# FIVERR-MAPS-RECORDER

To install the program: git clone https://github.com/salomonsa/FIVERR-MAPS-RECORDER.git

IMPORTANT STUFF, READ BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM:

1. Install the requirements in the requirements.txt file.
2. Screenshots are saved in the frames folder, their respective timestamps and coordinates are printed in the command line.
3. Once you start running the program, it asks you in the command line the coordinates to which you want to go and once this is inputted the program prints in the command line the hotkeys you can use and their respective functionality, and it opens a Chrome window with the Street View of those coordinates, do NOT change the size of this window or put it in full-screen mode because that could affect how the final recording looks (you can still minimize the window though), always exit the program by using the "Esc" hotkey, not by closing the window directly.
